# 🌱✨ L-Systems Playground ✨🌱

Welcome to **L-Systems**, a magical garden of code where fractals sprout and nature-inspired patterns bloom! 

## What is this? ˖˳·˖ ִֶָ ⋆🌷͙⋆ ִֶָ˖·˳˖ִ

This is a fun project for generating and exploring **Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems)** — those nifty mathematical rules that help us mimic how plants grow and create mesmerizing fractal art. Whether you’re a curious coder, a fractal fan, or just want to see some pretty patterns, you’re in the right place! 🍃💻

## Features

-  **Create your own L-Systems!** Pick your rules, axiom, and see where the algorithm takes you.
-  **Visualize growth!** Watch your fractal plant unfold step-by-step.
-  **Tweak and play!** Experiment with different rules and see how the garden changes.
-  **It’s all just for fun!** No pressure, just fractals.

## Getting Started ˖˳·˖ ִֶָ ⋆

1. **Clone this repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zeefromzee/l-systems.git
    cd l-systems
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any — check out the code for requirements).

3. **Run the magic:**
    - If there's a script, try something like:  
      `python lsystem.py`
    - Or explore the code and run your favorite bits!

## Example

Here’s a classic L-System rule for a tree:

```
Axiom: F
Rule: F → F[+F]F[-F]F
```

Watch your code garden grow and branch out! 🌳

## Contributing

Feel free to fork, play, and send pull requests. Even if you just want to share a cool fractal you made, we’d love to see it! :D



Happy coding, and may your fractals flourish!
